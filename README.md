## About the "Blind Tiger" Idea

The Blind Tiger website was inspired from my partner's love for the speakeasy bars in New York city. The purpose of the website is to create an online presence for existing and new customers to find out relevant information about the bar, its menu, and get a chance to reveal the secret location of the bar. 

This is a fictional speakeasy bar, established in Saint Petersburg, Florida, around 1921 (prohibition era: 1920-1933). The name "Blind Tiger" was chosen as it was widely used for establishments that sold intoxicants illegally.

This is the first of five Portfolio Projects that must be completed in order to obtain the Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications) from Code Institute.

## Main Requirements

The main requirements for the Project Portfolio 1:
- Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity.
- Test a Front-End web application through the development, implementation and deployment stages.
- Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform.
- Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation.
- Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub.

## Development Planes

### Strategy

Identifying the target audience:
- Fans of the 1920s
- Fans of the speakeasy bars
- Current customers
- Videographers
- Photographers

The website needs to allow the **user** to acquire desired information:
- The establisment's ethos
- The contact information
- The menu
- How to be informed about upcoming events
- Find out the secret location of the bar
- Connect with them on their preferred social platform

The website needs to provide the **establishment** with:
- An online presence 
- An easily navigable website for users to find relevant information
- A medium of communication for new/potntial and current fans
- A medium of communication for potential media enquirers and/or event bookers

### Scope
In order to accompish the strategy goals, a scope was developed with the followig **Content Requirements**:
- Ethos information
- Contact details
- Menu
- Secret Location form
- Social Links

### Structure
The **hierarchial tree structure** information architecture type was chosen in order to ensure that users will navigate through the site efficiently.

### Skeleton 
The Wireframe mockups were created with a [Figma Workspace](https://www.figma.com/file/llGzlYYGBOKyiv0H1A3NYx/The-Blind-Tiger-Speakeasy?node-id=0%3A1)

Home Page:

![Home Page Wireframe](assets/images/readme/home-page.jpg "Home Page Wireframe")

Sinner's Menu Page:

It's A Secret Page:

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The main colours used throughout the website are a black, gold, whitesmoke, and shades of dark red and navy blue.

### Typography
The fonts chosen were:
- [Josefin Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Slab "Link to Josefin Slab Google Font") is used for the body, with serif as the fallback font in case of import failure.
- [Great Vibes](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Great+Vibes "Link to Great Vibes Google Font") is used in the title of the website, with cursive as the fallback font in case of import failure. 
- [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display "Link to Playfair Display Google Font") is used for the home page and the sinner's menu page headings, with a serif as the fallback font in case of import failure.

## Features

### Design Features

1. The **Header** contains a cosistent and responsive **navigation bar** in the top left of all pages, and a **logo** in the top right of all pages (when clicking the logo the user will be redirect back to the home page). On screens below 850px width, the navigation bar collapses into a menu icon, when clicked it will reveal the navigation bar.

2. The **Footer** contains the **social media icons**, in the bottom left of all pages, the **copyrights** in the bottom middle of all pages, and the **terms & conditions** on the bottom right of all pages. For tablet screens (768px width) and below, the elements of the footer are stacked on top of one another

3. The **Home** page is divided into five sections:
     - Hero Image & Title
     - Be Prepared
     - Sinner's Menu link
     - Contact us 
     - Newsletter

4. The **Sinner's Menu** page is divided into three sections:
     - Sinner's Menu Image & Title
     - Menu
     - Happy Hour

5. The **It's A Secret** page features one section including the following:
     - Secret Location Image
     - Secret Location Title
     - Submission form

All elements were thoroughly checked for responsiveness in all screen sizes. The **Be Prepared** section, **Contact Us** section, and **Secret Location** form are divided in two columns for larger screen sizes. The **Menu** section, is divided into three columns for larger screen sizes. All of the above content is viewed as one column for smaller screen sizes.
 
### Existing Features

- **Header Navigation Bar** - Appears in every page and is positioned at a fixed place in order to ensure easy and effortless access to the navigational system.
- **Header Logo** - Appears in every page for brand recognition and is positioned with the navigation bar at a fixed place. When the logo is clicked the user will be redirected to the home page.
- **Action buttons** - Appear in the Home page and It's A Secret page, not including the Sinner's Menu Page. In the event of the buttons being active, the user will be redirected to internal and external sites such as:
     - Tel function for calling the establishment
     - Mailto function for contacting the establishment's customer support team
     - Menu link to redirect to the menu page
     - Email submission form
     - It's A Secret link to redirect to the It's A Secret page
- **Secret Location Form** - A form is used in the It's A Secret page, so the user can obtain the location of the establishment.
- **Social Media Icons** - Appear in every page. The icons depicts the various social media platforms, when hovered over they turn into the official colors of the coresponding social media platform.

### Back to the Feature (Features for the Future)

- **External Links** - Provide external resources for educational purposes
- **Form Validation** - Implement appropriate knowledge in order to validate the data of the form
- **404 Error Page** - Create a 404 error page to redirect the user back to safety

## Issues 

During the development process, the following issues were successfully corrected:

**Navigation Menu Icon** - While trying to implement a responsive navigation system, a navigation menu icon needed to be created with pure CSS. During research a solution was found and implemented from [CodePen](https://codepen.io/mutedblues/pen/MmPNPG?editors=1100 "Link to CodePen solution").

**Background Images Resizing** - During the development of the responsive part of the website, the background images and sections were not resizing properly. After thorough research online, slack, and trying to implement different techniques such as different structure of the elements, and various attribute combinations, the **Tutor Support** came for the rescue. At 2 AM on a Sunday, **Michael**, the tutor, found the solution to the problem. 

**Social Media Links positioning** - When trying to implement a responsive view for the footer of the website, the social media links were not positioned in the center in contrast with the copyrights and terms & conditions sections.
