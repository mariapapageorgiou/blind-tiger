                <h3>Play By The Rules</h3>
                <p>We are unavailable to accept reservations at the moment for any occasion.</p>
                <p>No smoking of any kind (vaping included) is allowed inside the <span>Blind Tiger</span>. Phonecalls or any other use of an 
                electronic device (yes, we are talking about your social media addiction) is not permitted. Only in case of an emergency and 
                step outside please. No compliance by the rules might lead to your early exit and say bye bye to your Mary Pickford cocktail 
                that just arrived.</p>
                <p>Service animals are welcome to join you. The treats are on us.</p>
                <p>Sitting will be assigned as first come first serve and based on your party size. In addition, due to the current COVID 
                restrictions enforced by the city, any party larger than 10 will have to go home (we have "eyes" everywhere). Wait times 
                might be longer than expected.</p>
                <p>We have a zero-tolerance policy against harassment, bullying and discrimination in place. Respect the LGBTQ 
                <span>(rainbow flag here)</span> community, all religions, all sexes, all races. ALL! No compliance by the rules will lead 
                to a permanent ban.</p>

        <div id="right-be-prepared">
                <h3>Your Vibe</h3>
                <p>21+ is the magic number for you to enter (age restrictions apply).</p>
                <p>Cocktail attire and period attire is encouraged. No hats, hoodies, sweatpants, flip-flops, or any sort of beach attire. 
                In three words: Dress to impress. In two: Upscale Casual.</p>
                <p>Let's pretend we are still in prohibition era and try to keep your conversations at a reasonable level.</p>
                <p>If you are a smoker, you can step outside to our smoking area.</p>
                <p>Social Media addicts, this is not the place for you. </p>
                <p>Drink responsibly. NEVER drink and drive.</p>
